Sass and Bulma custom CSS setup for vignette.agency website

This project provides a modular, maintainable CSS architecture using Bulma and custom Sass variables for the vignette.agency site. Only the required Bulma components are imported and customized, allowing for efficient, brand-aligned styling.

To build the CSS and watch for changes automatically, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will use the script `"start": "npm run build-bulma -- --watch"` to continuously compile your Sass files as you work.
